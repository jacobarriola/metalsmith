## 1. Sass Maps (@get-maps)
Before attending Sass Conf, I thought Sass maps and sourcemaps where the same thing. Lourdes and Mike gave excellent presentations on how to use the maps.

Basically, Sass maps give developers a way to structure data, similar to JSON with key/value pairings (Una has a excellent article on [5 great uses for Sass maps](http://www.sitepoint.com/5-great-uses-sass-maps/) ).

## 2. For Loops (@for)
As a WordPress developer, I'm super familiar with how loops work, so getting exposed to them in a Sass perspective was't too difficult for me. I attended Eva's Looping For Animation workshop. Turns out, animation is an awesome use-case for loops. She had us do a few excercises making animating SVG elements much DRYer.

## 3. SCSS Linting
Scss linting allows developers to create style rules for Sass. A style rule can be something like "Don't indent more than 3 levels deep".

## 4. Using VIM
Even though VIM isn't directly associated with Sass, as developers it's a tool we can use in our day-to-day. XXX

## 5. How to contribute to open source projects
I sat with Una with her CSSgram project and she broke down how to contribute.

## 6. Contributing to the Sass project isn't that difficult to do
Not be a Ruby or C developer, I initially felt that there wasn't anything I could do to contribute to the community. However, I met Jina, who maintains the Sass website, I realized that I could contribute in other ways that match my skill set.

## 7. Pattern libraries are a thing
