First of all, I have nothing against WordPress; it's a wonderful software
that solves many business problems. In fact, I develop a lot of applications/sites
using WordPress. The problem is, for my site, WordPress was no longer a viable
solution to my needs.

## Why
### 1. I don't have time to mess with databases
Because I'm not writing many articles, I just don't want to have to manage
databases, especially dealing with crazy security threats that I wouldn't know
how to manage/triage.

### 2. I don't have time for software updates

### 3. I don't have time for plugin updates

## Steps

### Step 1
Start with a skeleton project of `build.js`, `package.json`, and `src/` directory

### Step 2: create layouts

### Step 3: create partials

### Step 4: add your plugins
Collections, layouts
