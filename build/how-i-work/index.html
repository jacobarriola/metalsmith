  <h1>How I work</h1>
  <time>Wed Sep 17 2014 17:00:00 GMT-0700 (PDT)</time>
  <div class="tags">work</div>
  <p>I thought it would be a good idea to showcase some of the things I&#39;m using these
days to develop on the web.</p>
<p>I’m self taught and freelance, so I consider myself quite resourceful (thank you Google, MDN, Stack Overflow and Codex!) and motivated.  I’m a tedious //commenter
and see beauty in well indented and spaced code.</p>
<h2 id="home-base">Home base</h2>
<p>Working at home is great because of the flexibility and limited distractions.  When I do venture off  you can usually find me at a local Whittier coffee spot or at Kleverdog co-working in Chinatown.  Besides the great local food, co-working provides a great entrepreneurial environment and plenty of resources in case I need a second opinion.</p>
<h2 id="the-four-ps-of-programming">The four Ps of programming</h2>
<p>I use this methodology when programming because it gives me a systematic approach to doing things.  Otherwise, I&#39;ll find myself completely out of whack.  This methodology is courtesy of <a title="Twitter Page for Andrew Chalkley" href="https://twitter.com/chalkers">Andrew Chalkley</a> at <a title="Team Treehouse" href="https://teamtreehouse.com">Team Treehouse</a>.</p>
<pre><code>Prepare
//Define the problem
//Propose a solution
Plan
//Step 1
//Step 2
  //Step 2.1
  //Step 2.2
//Step 3
Perform
//This is where you actually code and nothing else.  You&#39;ve planned it out and should be executing here, unless something has gone wrong of course
Perfect
//Address bugs and feature requests post deployment
</code></pre><p>As of this post, here are the tools that I&#39;m currently using:</p>
<h2 id="notepad-and-a-pilot-precise-v5-pen">Notepad and a Pilot Precise V5 pen</h2>
<p>Despite all of the awesome digital tools out there, for me, everything starts on a piece of paper and an easy-to-write pen. Even if it&#39;s the most basic visualization, putting something down on paper is an ideal starting point for me rather than trying to do something on the computer first.</p>
<h2 id="asana">Asana</h2>
<p>I can’t function() (← get the joke!?) without a to-do list to plan out my day.  No matter what technology you choose, plan out your day.  Lately, I&#39;ve started writing out my to-do list the night before.  And when I get started in the day I&#39;ll add more things or modify.</p>
<h2 id="git">Git</h2>
<p>Seriously, if you&#39;re not using Git or some kind of SVN, get started today.  Git is super easy to learn and makes you feel like a bad ass when you start firing off commands on the Terminal.  Just like all tech, start small and work your way up - there&#39;s a big community out there to help.  Give it some time, and you&#39;ll hit that &#39;ah-ha&#39; moment in no time.</p>
<h2 id="sass">Sass</h2>
<p>I heard about Sass from the awesome LA/OC WP folks.  After hearing them present Sass, I took some time to give it a shot.</p>
<p>Sass helps you write CSS like a rockstar - variables, mixins, nesting.  It helps you organize your files and introduces programatic components that save you time while developing and especially when modifying.  Any developer looking to improve her workflow should give Sass a shot.</p>
<p>Get started using Sass to organize your files, name a few variables and nest - after that, introduce some mixins and you&#39;ll be flying in no time!</p>
<h2 id="zurb-foundation">Zurb Foundation</h2>
<p>Foundation is a front-end framework that helps me build things faster.  They have great documentation and are super responsive.  It&#39;s a mobile-first approach that&#39;s completely customizable to your dev needs.  It plays nice with Sass too!</p>
<p>I really like their grid system the most.  The class names are very intuitive and are easy to pick up.  The framework gives you a lot of layout/positioning options to meet your needs as well.</p>
<p>They also have out-of-the-box navigation systems as simple or as complex as you need them to be using Javascript and jQuery.</p>
